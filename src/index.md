I work with artists, studios, designers, and individuals to create fully tailored websites with a focus on simplicity, usability, and sustainability.

I enjoy using [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/), Alpine JS and Tailwind. Other relevant experience includes serverside development (Eleventy, Node.js, PHP, Python), CSS (SASS), JavaScript (jQuery, TypeScript), Third-party integrations (Mailchimp, Shopify, Vimeo, Leaflet, Mapbox, Indexhibit), and technical consultation. I am also proficient with Adobe Suite.

Examples of recent work: [Pech](https://pech.is), [fjk3](https://fjk3.com) (Design: Hannah Sakai / TiD), [ILIT](https://transforminglibraries.net) (Design: Alessia Scuderi), [MXR](https://mxr.at) (Design: brand unit), [Entkunstung](https://entkunstung.com) (Design: Maximilian Mauracher). Full portfolio upon request.

My office is in Vienna. I am currently looking for new commissions and am always available to chat. Feel free to reach out! ðŸŒ·
